# Stock Analysis with Visual Basic Applications (VBA)

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to compare select stock data from 2017 and 2018, along with refactoring code to determine if the new code affects performance of the scripts run to calculate stock performance.


## Results: 
### Stock Performance
As evidenced by the 2017 to 2018 Select Stock Performance graph below, stock performance for 2017 produced better returns than the dismal performance of 2018. Only two stocks, ENPH and RUN produced positive returns in both years.  SEDG had the second best returns in 2017, with minimal losses is 2018.  Although DQ was the highest perfoming stock in 2017, it also had the highest overall loss in 2018, showing great volatility.
